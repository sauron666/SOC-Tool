Netcraft Takedown API (Version 1)
The Takedown API allows you to integrate your automated tools into the Netcraft Takedown service.

A number of different endpoints are provided which allow you to view information about your attacks and service configuration, as well as report new attacks and make changes to existing takedowns.

Rate Limits
Please note that all of the API endpoints are subject to rate limiting. The limit is 120 requests per minute. This applies to the total number of requests across all endpoints, i.e. if you make 60 requests to /report and 60 to /attacks in the space of a minute you will hit the rate limit. This rate limiting is applied based on the IP address of the machine making the request.

There is also a limit of 1,000,000 entries returned within a 24 hour period (moving time window) for the /attacks endpoint. This rate limiting is applied based on the email address that calls the API.

If either rate limit is exceeded, a 429 Too Many Requests response with the following response is returned:

{"error":"rate_limited"}
Legacy Documentation
The v1 API is backwards-compatible with the legacy API. The v1 documentation should be used even if you haven't migrated to the v1 endpoints.

If you still require the legacy API documentation, you can find it here.

Please note that the legacy documentation is no longer maintained, and its use is therefore discouraged.

Authentication
Bearer Auth
For bearer authentication, you must provide an API key inside the Authorization header as follows:

Authorization: Bearer EXAMPLE5ze79ph0QKDLu2TAlNQdWloFt

You can manage your API keys here. Make sure you copy the API key to a secure location (e.g. a password manager) since it will not be shown again in the account portal after you've generated it.

Minimum Access Level Required	Authoriser
Testing Endpoint 	https://takedown.netcraft.com/api/v1/test/report/
Deprecated Endpoint Name 	https://takedown.netcraft.com/authorise.php
This endpoint can be used to report a new attack or authorise an existing attack in the Takedown service.

If a takedown for the attack already exists in the system it will be authorised, otherwise, a new takedown will be added and authorised.

All submissions to this endpoint should be pre-validated. If you are reporting URLs from an external source without verification then you should submit these to the Netcraft Report service (API).

Note that whilst a minimum of "Authoriser" access is required to access this endpoint, you will not be able to authorise a takedown that requires managed credits without an access level of "Escalator" or higher.

Submissions from some reporters may go through additional verification before appearing in the takedown system. This will be indicated by the TD_VERIFY response. A report receiving this response may appear in Takedown after some delay, or not at all if verification fails.To submit binary data (dropsite or email evidence) the "multipart/form-data" request schema must be used.

Note that authorising a takedown may cost one or more credits.

This is required for all malware attacks where the type parameter has not been provided.
